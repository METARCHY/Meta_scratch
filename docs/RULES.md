# Metarchy — Rules (Player-Facing)

> This is the canonical, complete rulebook for Metarchy. Written for players, not developers. For technical implementation details, see `MECHANICS.md`.

---

## Goal of the Game

Accumulate the most **Victory Points (VP)** by the end of the final Turn.

```
1 Victory Point = 1 Power + 1 Art + 1 Knowledge
```

**Glory** is a wild-card Value that fills whichever of {Power, Art, Knowledge} you have the least of.

If players are tied in VP after the final Turn, they play one additional tie-breaker Turn.

---

## Arguments (Rock-Paper-Scissors + Dummy)

| 🪆 **Dummy** | Nothing | Rock, Paper, Scissors | Dummy |

---

## Bets

When sending an Actor, you **may** attach a Bet by spending 1 Resource. Each Actor can have at most 1 Bet. The Resource is **always consumed** regardless of outcome.

| Resource Spent | You Bet On | If Bet Succeeds |
|---|---|---|
| ⚙️ **Production** | Win | Actor brings +1 **extra** Value or Resource |
| 🔋 **Electricity** | Lose | The Conflict is **re-resolved** (second chance) |
| ♻️ **Recycling** | Draw | Draw counts as **Win** for your Actor |

---

## Values & Resources

### Values (for Victory Points)
- 👑 **Power** — created by Politicians
- 🎨 **Art** — created by Artists
- 📖 **Knowledge** — created by Scientists
- ⭐ **Glory** — earned via Events (wild card, fills your lowest Value)

### Resources (for Bets & Market)
- ⚙️ **Production** — from Factory (also bets on Win)
- 🔋 **Electricity** — from Energy Plant (also bets on Lose)
- ♻️ **Recycling** — from Dump (also bets on Draw)

---

## Turn Phases

### Phase 1: Event (starts from Turn 2)

A random **Event Card** is revealed. There are 7 possible events:

**Compare Events** (reward: Glory):
- **Political Repression** — player with the **least** Power gets Glory
- **Educational Crisis** — player with the **least** Knowledge gets Glory
- **Cultural Decline** — player with the **least** Art gets Glory
- **Revolution** — player with the **most** Power gets Glory

**Discard Events** (reward: random Action Card):
- **Help Poor Countries** — secretly discard Production; most discarded wins
- **Earth Hour** — secretly discard Electricity; most discarded wins
- **Prevent Eco-Crisis** — secretly discard Recycling; most discarded wins

If tied, resolve with Rock-Paper-Scissors.

---

### Phase 2: Distribution

**Secretly** assign all 4 of your Actors:
1. Choose a **Location** (must be valid for that Actor type)
2. Assign an **Argument** (Rock/Paper/Scissors/Dummy — each Actor gets a unique one)
3. Optionally attach a **Bet** (costs 1 Resource)

You can only see your own placements. Other players' distributions are hidden.

After all players confirm, the game advances.

---

### Phase 3: Action Cards (4 Steps)

All Actors and their Locations are **revealed** (Arguments and Bets stay hidden).

Players simultaneously commit Action Cards in this strict order:

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| **Step 1: Bidding** | (Reserved for future use) |
| **Step 2: Block Locations** | Play location-blocking cards (disables a Location for this turn) |
| **Step 3: Relocation** | Move an Actor from one Location to another valid Location |
| **Step 4: Exchange** | Exchange one of your Values with another player's Value |

Players can play **any number** of Action Cards per step (of the correct type).

---

### Phase 4: Conflict Resolution

**Arguments and Bets are revealed.** Conflicts are resolved location by location:

1. **No conflict** (only one Actor of a type at a Location): That Actor auto-wins and produces its Value/Resources.
   - If it had a Win bet → bet succeeds, +1 extra reward
   - If it had a Draw or Lose bet → bet fails (resource still consumed)

2. **Conflict** (2+ Actors of the same type at a Location):
   - Arguments are compared using RPS rules
   - **Winner** gets full rewards
   - **Loser** gets nothing
   - **Draw** behavior depends on Actor type (see Actors section above)
   - Bets are checked against the outcome

---

### Phase 5: Market

You may spend **1 Production + 1 Electricity + 1 Recycling** to buy a **random Action Card**.

After the Market Phase, the Turn ends and the next Turn begins with Phase 1.

**If it was the final Turn:** the game ends after Phase 4 (Conflict Resolution). Count VPs to determine the winner.

---

## Action Cards (15-card deck)

### Location Blockers (6 cards, 1 each)
| Card | Disables |
|---|---|
| **Construction Work** | Square |
| **Reconstruction** (Charity Event) | Theatre |
| **Student Protests** (Student Strikes) | University |
| **Sabotage** | Factory |
| **Cable Stolen** (Blackout) | Energy Plant |
| **Environmental Protests** (Ecological Protest) | Dump |

When a Location is disabled: no Conflicts happen there, and Actors produce no Values/Resources.

### Relocation (6 cards)
Move one of your Actors (along with its Argument and Bet) to any other **valid** Location for that Actor type. Useful for escaping blocked Locations.

### Change Values (3 cards)
Exchange one of your Values (Power, Knowledge, or Art) for one Value of another player. Cannot exchange Glory.

### How to Get Action Cards
- **Events:** Win a discard-type Event → random Action Card
- **Market:** Spend 1 Production + 1 Electricity + 1 Recycling → random Action Card
- Cards are always received randomly from the deck

## Victory Point Calculation

At game end:

1. **Distribute Glory:** Each Glory point is added to your lowest Value (Power, Art, or Knowledge), one at a time
2. **Calculate VP:** `VP = min(Power, Art, Knowledge)`
3. **Winner:** Player with the most VP wins
4. **Tie:** Play one additional Turn
